This is a simple starter for a next.js website suitable for deployment as a static app to any CDN or static provider. Its overall implementation, as well look and feel were adapted from [johnpolacek/nextjs-mdx-blog-starter](https://github.com/johnpolacek/nextjs-mdx-blog-starter). The main addition included here is a conversion to typescript:

## Typescript

Typescript is a superset of the ECMAScript/Javascript standards that adds type analysis to your javascript code. In practice it replaces libraries like `prop-types` when working with React.js. While the learning curve can be slippery for folks new to typed languages, the payoff for that work comes quickly and builds over time.

Adapted from original about page text by [John Polacek](http://johnpolacek.com/):

## Next.js

I reach for Next.js because it scales to what I need it to do. It can build a simple static blog like this one, or a SaaS app with parameterized routing, serverless backend, user authentication and an integrated API (see my [Hello Next App](https://hellonextapp.com/) project for example).

## MDX

MDX is a powerful tool for authoring content. It gives you everything that authoring your content in markdown does, but with the added superpower of being able to drop in React components at will. For a web developer blog, thatâ€™s obviously pretty appealing.

## Theme UI

[Theme UI](https://theme-ui.com/home/) gives you a base set of [UI components](https://theme-ui.com/components) that let me style and layout web components with ease. The [sx prop](https://theme-ui.com/sx-prop) is magic. No thinking about class names, the cascade or how my CSS is going to scale. Write your styles, then get minified, atomic classes and automatically generated [critical CSS](https://web.dev/extract-critical-css/) for your pages. Great for devs, and great for users.

## Vercel

[Vercel](https://vercel.com/) provides streamlined deployment and hosting via [CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli#getting-started). They are also the company behind Next.js.
